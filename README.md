## A public list of what I'd like to accomplish!
### In the next six months, I'd like to...
1. Make a portfolio site that I am proud of.
2. Finish the Front End development paths I have started so far:
  * Treehouse's Front End Web Developer Track
  * Free Code Camp's Front End Development Certificate
3. Practice Khan Academy Math every week (with the goal to get to calculus by the end of the year)
4. Learn the basics of computer science via CS50x
5. Relearn Photoshop and Illustrator
6. Finish the knitting projects I deem eligible:
  * Multigrain Scarf
  * Red Eden sweater for my wedding
  * Wandering Ribs Hat
  * Sno and Tynd Pullover
  * Whatever the Cumbria Pullover is going to be
7. Occasionally practice my other hobbies while using up the materials I have:
  * Drawing/sketching/coloring
  * Sewing
  * Film Photography

Every Sunday evening, I will write a summary of what I have accomplished, and update the status of each project.
